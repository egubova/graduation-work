# Graduation work
date: 06/2021

Bachelor's graduate work on the topic: "Three-component conjugate gradient methods for solving high-dimensional optimization problems". 
A new optimization method was developed, which demonstrated high performance.

The *methods* files contain the implementation of my own method and some basic algorithms that are compared with. In the *cute_methods* file, the methods are implemented for conducting numerical experiments using the pycutest library (it works only on UNIX operating systems). And the *quad_methods* file contains an implementation of the same methods, but for testing on quadratic optimization problems (Ridge regression). 

In the *main* files, the methods themselves are tested directly, as well as the construction of graphs. 

The *cute* and *quad* parts of the program work separately from each other. 

In the file *problem_list.txt* contains a list of optimization problems from the CUTEst library, on which numerical experiments were conducted. 

The *Work_report.pdf* file contains a full report on the work performed (93 pages).
